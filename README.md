# MonaFeels — Mobile demo (Expo / Snack)

This is a lightweight Expo React Native demo of the Mona/Feels app.
Run via Expo Snack (https://snack.expo.dev) or clone into Expo.

## How to run (Snack – easiest)
1. Open https://snack.expo.dev on your phone browser
2. Create a new Snack
3. Paste the files (App.js, screens/, components/, ai/LocalAIMock.js)
4. Tap "Run on Device" -> "Open in Expo Go"

## Notes
- This demo uses LocalAIMock for mood detection (no API keys).
